/// # The Environment
///
/// Processes on platforms supported by Crux all have an associated
/// "environment", which simply stores a bunch of key/value string pairs. You
/// can think of it like a `HashMap<String, String>` that's managed by the
/// operating system and is specific to each process (e.g. each process has its
/// own `HashMap`/environment).
///
/// Entries in the environment are called environment variables. Environment
/// variables typically have an associated value, but may simply store an empty
/// string, representing no value.
///
/// Note that because the environment is managed by the operating system, its
/// keys and values may not be valid UTF-8 strings, as different operating
/// systems use different encodings for strings. Crux automatically attempts to
/// convert environment values to UTF-8 for you; any invalid characters are
/// simply replaced with the UTF-8 replacement character ('ï¿½').
///
/// In addition, environments are specific to a *process*, not a thread. This
/// means two threads in the same process share environments. So if you read an
/// environment variable, then read it again later, it might store a different
/// value the second time you read from it because a background thread could
/// have updated the environment variable.

///   encoded in something other than UTF-8, or could be corrupted)
/// - Has an unspecified lifetime, as another thread in the process could modify
///   or delete the environment variable at any time
///
/// [`get_env`] is safer because it immediately clones the environment variable
/// into a UTF-8 Rust string with a known lifetime.
